### Description
This webapp is simply a way to keep track of the movies and tv show you want to watch. Every streaming service out there has a watchlist, but they are all limited to whats in the library of that service. This app allows you to add any movie or tv show to the list, and even gives recommendations based on what you've already watched or whats currently in your watchlist.

### Instructions
To use, simply start adding items to your watchlist via the "+" button. Items will appear in your list. If you finish an item, swipe it to the right and select "complete." If you dislike something or want to remove it from the list, swipe it to the left and select "delete." To get recommendations, check out the recommendations page. This will be empty unless there are items currently in your watchlist or archive.

Keep in mind that because this app uses a third party api for most of the data, it might take some time for information and images to load depending on your connection.

### Features
- API integration for movie search and recommendation
- Locally storing watchlist, archive, and deleted items
- Swipe / Gestural interaction
